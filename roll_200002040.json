He climbs the learning curve like a ladder; he's the sole force behind our project's success. He's not just good; he's OP! He never speaks ill of others yet he is able to contribute to the gossip. He gives such apt references. Talking to him gives me a direction. Our connection is deep enough to communicate semi-verbally. Will always cherish his company. Maqsad nahi bhulna hai ðŸ’ª.",
