Guessed his password on 3rd attempt (he still wouldn't change it XD). He is a candid guy with a lot of clarity in life. He never fails to notice the things others overlook, even when I secretly hope nobody noticed; but Satwik always does. I always go to him for all my big decisions.","name":"Gaurav Jain","roll_no":"200001023"},{"comment":"Ahh, you definitely love train journeys 😏😂.
