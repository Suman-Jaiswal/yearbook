[{"comment":"I enjoyed our trip to Coimbatore, where we played bluff on the train and watched \"Dark Knight\" on the bus ride back. When you forgot your phone in the train restroom, we searched the entire coach for it. Moments like those are unforgettable.","name":"Amit Kumar Makkad"},{"comment":"Bhai 5 minutes is not equal to 2 hours.

Kabhi phone nahi lata hai, proof that even the brightest minds can have black holes in their pockets. Here's to surviving two years of engineering with a permanent case of 'lost phone.'It was a great time from meeting after quarantine and becoming a great friend. We will be in touch... if you carry your phone! Otherwise, we'll just have to resort to sending carrier pigeons or smoke signals. Either way, we'll find a way to track you down, phone or no phone! Stay connected, even if it's by carrier pigeon!' 🐦📱","name":"Nishit"},{"comment":"Nishchay, you're one of the three train travel buddy of our college journey to and from home.
