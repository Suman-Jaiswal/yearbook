[{"comment":"Dear 5-star, thanks for patiently listening to my nonsensical talks and philosophies. Vo raat bhar jag kar bakwas karna, apni boriyat mitane ke liye tujhe pareshan karna, teri confusions clear karte karte khud confuse ho jana... I'm gonna miss them yaar. Don't worry, I will never let you forget me♥️","name":"Vandana Jha","roll_no":"200003081"},{"comment":"Sneha ji, you're the most sensible jab tak aapko chai mil rhi, decisive person jab tak aapko choice na dede, extrovert jab tak aap sheeshe se baat kr rhi h and most importantly mera 'BANK'.
