[{"comment":"Dear 5-star, thanks for patiently listening to my nonsensical talks and philosophies. Vo raat bhar jag kar bakwas karna, apni boriyat mitane ke liye tujhe pareshan karna, teri confusions clear karte karte khud confuse ho jana... I'm gonna miss them yaar. Don't worry, I will never let you forget me♥️","name":"Vandana Jha"},{"comment":"My sweetest, quiet friend. Loved our conversations. Don't you dare forget me!
