Someone who is difficult to spot but is often found with his close friends around LRC. The ideal roomate who never caused any trouble. All the best for your journey ahead.","name":"Yeeshukant Singh","roll_no":"200002082"},{"comment":"Roommate and a good badminton player. Core EE guy(I don't know why he didn't consider himself one, though). Has many funky stories to tell(iykyk). Can say FSZ is his 2nd room(one might say 1st too).

Mostly found in FSZ(Could say his 1st room). But that shows his determination towards studies. Keep working hard and achieve everything you desire in your life. All the best bro for your future!!
