[{"comment":"One of the first friends I made after coming to campus...GAWWWD badminton player (par merese acha nhi)...very hardworking...lot to learn from you brother... best of luck for future","name":"Pranjal Sonkar"},{"comment":"People consider him as an introvert but if you prompt him then he can talk for hours on all kinds of random things. Someone who is difficult to spot but is often found with his close friends around LRC. The ideal roomate who never caused any trouble. All the best for your journey ahead.","name":"Yeeshukant Singh"},{"comment":"Roommate and a good badminton player. Core EE guy(I don't know why he didn't consider himself one, though). Has many funky stories to tell(iykyk). Can say FSZ is his 2nd room(one might say 1st too). ","name":"Atharva Tayshete"},{"comment":"Roommate and friend. Could say he is pseudo roommate thoughðŸ˜‚coz you could hardly find him in his room. Mostly found in FSZ(Could say his 1st room). But that shows his determination towards studies. Keep working hard and achieve everything you desire in your life. All the best bro for your future!! ","name":"Jyotirmay Mitra"}]
