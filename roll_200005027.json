MUN cohead, BTP partner, fellow TPC member, maza aaya tre saath kaam karke kaafi.

She denies being called a 'topper' even though she is one 😇. One of the best friends I made on campus, and I hope that you achieve everything ahead. All the best !!","name":"Jitin Sathish Kumar","roll_no":"200005018"},{"comment":"Incredibly talented, down-to-earth and one of the most positive people I've met on campus.
