[{"comment":"The most unique (DASH) person I have ever met, and I doubt I will meet another like him in the future. His dedication level is impressive, and he genuinely enjoys his work, not just for getting marks. I really enjoyed being your roommate and the moments we shared (which Mihir recorded😂).","name":"Amit Kumar Makkad"},{"comment":"One always has to be on their toes when they are around you! You have one of the most curious, child-like minds, and I hope it stays that way forever. Thank you for making 304 entertaining and for providing quality content 😂 ","name":"Mihir Karandikar"},{"comment":"If you were a girl, I would have married you already XD. You are such a relatable person You understand me inside out. You are my academic backbone. From infinity remote to hangman, nothing of this would have been easier without you. Ours is very mutual bond made in heaven. We stay for lifetime!!","name":"Satwik Vankayalapati"},{"comment":"A multitalented person and CEO of the startup \"OnlyJains\". Never picks up calls nor replies to messages. Always has \"hidden papers\" for every subject. First person who is more choosy than me in eating. Beware before drinking water from his bottle (P.S: If you are drunk, it will definitely bring you back to reality @Fluxus 2023). He tried to increase his CPI using the \"CR effect\" but to no avail. Changed quiz dates and timing for his own benefits😂😂 and was a vitness (or one of the culprit?) in screen closure during ML lecture.  I hope you find a Jain girl soon so that yours parents are free. Stay connected!","name":"Nishit"},{"comment":"A really unique person who is simple and smart at the same time. Does the most impractical things in the most practical ways.
