[{"comment":"Mihir is the most disciplined guy I have ever met, and I spend much time with him. He is the first person I go to when I have difficulties, like my fire brigade (TMKOC). He is constantly pushing me to exercise and avoid sweets. He is an ideal friend, except when he criticizes my computer vision😂.","name":"Amit Kumar Makkad"},{"comment":"He has the best outlook on life; he shows you the other side. You ask him why, and he says why not? Most reliable teammate, disciplined individual and focussed person, he can handle so so many tasks at once.

Definitely a very memorable and inspiring person.","name":"Vihaan Thora"},{"comment":"A Productive Powerhouse behind an ordinary face.

A Roomie who needs a lot of personal space.","name":"Gaurav Khushpat Jain"},{"comment":"Cheers to our in-house Mr Perfect!\nSometimes, he can be a royal pain. 😉But he is a wonderful person and a loyal friend.
