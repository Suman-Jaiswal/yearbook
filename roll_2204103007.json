Whenever I felt good, I came to your lab to overcome it. And yes, your cooking skill is fantastic.   I wish you a very good Ph.D. in Good university. Hare Krishna ","name":"Zen Kapadiya"},{"comment":"The first ever Bengali guy I ever met who defy all the traits of being a Bengali 😂. The most religious person in our entire unit with whom you can share your any thoughts to get a spritual angle. I always enjoyed our intense late night discussion over your delicious cooked food. All the best mate!!","name":"Isparsh Chauhan"},{"comment":"Ki holo bokac-#@, manik is the person that i think i have found myself the most comfterbale with.

Best of luck in life bondhu.🙏","name":"Harsh Vardhan Singh"},{"comment":"Manik da, you've always been a great 'da,' always there when I needed help. Your life truly inspires a Bengali like me. I even bought the Bhagavad Gita but haven't read a single page yet. I hope we meet again in the next phase of our lives, and then you might teach me the lessons of the BhagavadGita","name":"Prosenjit Mondal"},{"comment":"Nomoskar Manikda!!, our resident jack-of-all-trades: a cooker extraordinaire, badminton ace, a saintly soul, and a debatable guy, of course.
