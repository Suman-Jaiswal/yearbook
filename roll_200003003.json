Some of the most memorable memories that we made together, remember during Fluxus, you did something... You were always very helpful and supportive! Alas keep posting on Instagram😂","name":"Krish Agrawal"},{"comment":"So many things to say about this person that any single comment will be inaccurate. Achievements se hi page bhar jayega, baaki sab ke liye to novel likhna padega. Panda is simply too much of a person to explain in one comment, and proudly so. Good for me, kyunki time kam pad rha hai","name":"Ashutosh Nayak"},{"comment":"I haven't met anyone as carefree & responsible as you. Notebook & shampoo bhi le chalenge blr(iykyk).
