Alas keep posting on Instagram😂","name":"Krish Agrawal"},{"comment":"So many things to say about this person that any single comment will be inaccurate. Achievements se hi page bhar jayega, baaki sab ke liye to novel likhna padega. Panda is simply too much of a person to explain in one comment, and proudly so.
