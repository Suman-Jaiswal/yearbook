When he enters class, he looks like a professor; in a mess, he resembles a manga character; without specs, he looks like Salman Khan in \"Tere NaamðŸ˜‚.\" Now, all the best for becoming a manager, and please try to look like that.","name":"Amit Kumar Makkad","roll_no":"200001003"},{"comment":"Your laughter and sense of humor are truly unique, almost otherworldly. Your intellect is so high that you couldn't care less about the world around you (you didn't even bat an eye when Bill Gates passed by). Conversing with you is an absolute blast.

It is common to hear him laugh out loud in his room or give out some kind of random commentary ðŸ˜‚. Also has a really humorous side to him, which he expresses at times we least expect, which makes it even funnier. Really lucky to have you as a flatmate!","name":"Jitin Sathish Kumar","roll_no":"200005018"},{"comment":"He is one of the most unique people I have ever met, and when I say unique, I mean absolutely different. Never met someone with such randomness and spontaneity that it is hard to follow how he gets from one thought to another.
